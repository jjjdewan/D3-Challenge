          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h3>
          <p>The above charts depicts positive correlations between the risk factors obesity and smoking with respect to 
            poverty and household income. 
            It is evident that people with low Household Income and States with higher poverty rate have higher Obesity and higher smoking rate.
            States with higher Househiold income can afford better healtcare coverage and they have lower obisity rate.
            The charts also shows that there are somme outliers in this case study.
            For example, North Dakota(ND) and Iowa has relatively low poverty rate, but, high obesity rates.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age</h3>
          <p>The correlations between health risks and age are rather complex and interesrting indeed.
            It is evident from the chart on Obisity vs Age that majority of the states shows higher  obisity rates within the median age of 35-42.
            This is alarming indeed for the middle age group of popluation who is the main source of productivity.
            It is also observed that majority of the states smoking rates lies within the median age group between 35-42.
            The same age group is lacking heathcare as well.
            Moreover, we discovered that the lower the median age, lower is the health risk.
            Therefore, there are some good correlations between "Health Risk and Age".</p>
